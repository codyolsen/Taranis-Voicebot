# Taranis-Voicebot
A Mac shell script to generate voice files for the Taranis series of RC radio control systems.

#Instructions
1. Download Taranis-TTV.sh and EN-Taranis-Daniel.csv
1. Make Taranis-TTV.sh executable with `chmod +x Taranis-TTV.sh`
1. Customise EN-Taranis-Daniel.csv with the phrases you'd like to use. It's best to add yours at the bottom - use the same filenames as the defaults and they will overwrite the originals.
1. Run `./Taranis-TTV.sh EN-Taranis-Daniel.csv` to generate the output folders and all all the sound files.
1. Copy the SOUNDS folder to your Taranis.
