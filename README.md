# Taranis-Voicebot
A high-quality male-voiced soundpack for your Taranis or other OpenTX radio. Easily customisable, all sounds are generated by a script that pulls your phrases from a simple CSV file and names them appropriately.

# Installation
1. Click the **Clone or Download** button.
1. Click **Download Zip**.
1. Copy the **SOUNDS/en** folder into the **SOUNDS** folder on your Taranis SD card. (You might want to keep your existing en folder somewhere. I called mine en-old.)

# Customisation
1. Download `Taranis-Voicebot.sh` and `EN-Taranis-Daniel.csv` (all sounds will be generated, so no need to download these unless you want to).
1. Make `Taranis-Voicebot.sh` executable with `chmod +x Taranis-Voicebot.sh`
1. Customise `EN-Taranis-Daniel.csv` with the phrases you'd like to use. It's best to add yours at the bottom - use the same filenames as the defaults and they will overwrite the originals. **NOTE:** you must leave a blank line at the end because of reasons. If you don't, the final sound will not be generated.
1. Run `./Taranis-Voicebot.sh EN-Taranis-Daniel.csv` to generate the output folders and all all the sound files.
1. Copy the SOUNDS folder to your Taranis SD card.
